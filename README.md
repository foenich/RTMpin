# RTMpin
This is a pinball project.

A Rollergames playfield was turned into a hybrid pinball machine (pinball firmware via PinMAME like in virtual pinball, but with real playfield and steel balls).

The emulator PinMAME runs on a Raspberry Pi and controls sound, DMD and a few IO-boards underneath the playfield. These in turn read the switch positions and activates the coils and lamps.

A word of warning: this is a private, non commercial hobby project. Hardware and software still has errors (see issues and Changes.txt). To make use of anything of this project a basic understanding of electronics and programming is necessary. Nothing of it is "plug and play". I'm surely not liable for any damage to assemblies, pinball machines or even persons.
