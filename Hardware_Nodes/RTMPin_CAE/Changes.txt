# Todos for next version (after RTMPIN 0.1.0):
* move C24 a bit to the right (access for USB-connector)
* move C32 down or U4 up (BlackPill exaggerates the DIP-Socket at the bottom side an conflicts with C32)
* U2, U5, U7: may use a different housing for 74LVC14 (e.g. TSSOP14), because better available
* Exchange Rx and Tx at RS485-driver to the STM-controller
* Use a pull down instead of a pull up at nRE/DE of RS485
