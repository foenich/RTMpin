# Firmware for IO boards
Firmware is written and compiled with STM32CubeIDE.

For now every node has it's own firmware: 3 nodes -> 3 firmware folders.

Another folder contains the bootloader firmware witch is the same for all nodes.

Furthermore there are Python (V3) scripts for updating the nodes from the Raspberry Pi.
